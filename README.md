# COVID-19-Dataset-Exploration---Regression-and-Classification-Models
This repository contains all the information relating to my group's Final Project for UC Berkeley Course Data 100 - Principles &amp; Techniques of Data Science for the Spring 2020 Semester.

We used multiple datasets to create 2 Linear Regression Models and 1 Classification model for answering different questions. &amp;
The first two linear regression models answer questions about how the deaths are spreading in different states and counties. The &amp; classification model categorizes different countries in different risk category levels - Community Transmssion (High Risk), Clusters of&amp; Cases (Medium Risk) and Sporadic Cases (Low Risk).
